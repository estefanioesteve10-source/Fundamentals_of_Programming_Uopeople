Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language that has become one of the most popular tools in the technological world.

Created by Guido van Rossum and released in 1991, its core philosophy focuses on code readability and developer productivity. Instead of dealing with complex syntax full of symbols (such as mandatory curly braces or semicolons), Python uses indentation to define code blocks, making it very similar to reading an English text.

Key Features
Simple Syntax: It is easy to learn, making it an ideal entry point for beginners.

Interpreted: Code is executed line by line, which facilitates testing and error correction (debugging).

Cross-platform: Works on Windows, macOS, Linux, and even mobile devices.

Giant Standard Library: It has thousands of ready-made packages that allow you to do everything from complex mathematical calculations to network automation without having to "reinvent the wheel".

Where is Python used? Python's versatility makes it the "Swiss Army knife" of modern technology:

Data Science and AI: It's the number one language for Machine Learning, data analysis, and Artificial Intelligence.

Web Development: Through frameworks like Django and Flask, it supports the backend of websites like Instagram and Spotify.

Automation (Scripting): Excellent for automating repetitive tasks, such as organizing files or collecting data from the internet (web scraping).

Education: Because it's readable, it's the standard language used in computer science courses around the globe.

Why choose Python?

Unlike languages ​​like C++ or Java, where you need to write a lot of code to perform a simple task, in Python you focus on the problem and not on the complexity of the language.
